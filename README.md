# Python Small Projects

This repository is aimed for keep my small projects developed in Python.
Each project has a specific propose, and during the time I will spend developing it I will also try 
to develop some programming concepts related to Performance, Clean Code and Complexity.

Projects:
- **findBigFiles.py**: Used for checking all the large files on my system. 
- **mongodbReport.py**: Simple script to collect informations about a MongoDB instance (WIP)
- **punchingTheClock.py**: I always forget to punch in or out of office (WIP)
